### Linked Lists
    - [ ] Description:
    	- [ ] [Linked Lists CS50 Harvard University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T-A_GFuoTo&t=650s) - this builds the intuition.

    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.

    - [ ] Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [ ] size() - returns the number of data elements in the list
        - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [ ] pop_front() - remove the front item and return its value
        - [ ] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [ ] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [ ] front() - get the value of the front item
        - [ ] back() - get the value of the end item
        - [ ] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so the current item at that index is pointed to by the new item at the index
        - [ ] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [ ] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at the nth position from the end of the list
        - [ ] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value

        - No need to implement
